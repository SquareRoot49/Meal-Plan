                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    At Meal Planner, we believe that healthy eating should be simple, enjoyable, and personalized. 
                    Our mission is to help people design their daily meals based on their unique calorie goals and 
                    dietary preferences, making nutrition planning accessible to everyone.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Why We Created This</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people struggle with meal planning because they don't know how to balance their nutrition 
                    or what foods to choose. We've built an intelligent system that takes the guesswork out of 
                    meal planning by providing personalized recommendations based on your specific needs.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    We use a data-driven approach to create balanced meal plans that distribute calories 
                    appropriately across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Our algorithm considers your 
                    dietary restrictions and preferences to ensure every meal plan is tailored to your lifestyle.
